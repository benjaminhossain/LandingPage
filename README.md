## Description

This is a project for Udacity Front-end Web Development Nanodegree Program. I converted a static website provided by Udacity and made it a dynamic website using JavaScript. For example, I used JS to make a dynamic navigation bar on the website, which scrolls to the right section when clicked. Also, it shows the active section while scrolling through the page. All of these were done by JS.
